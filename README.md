Shortcut Creator for Media Player Classic

### Instead of introduction

This little piece of program was created in just two or three hours for personal use with private film collection. Well, yes. I've got a great lot of films. And all of them are situated in 5 different HDDs. Creating a folder with shortcuts to all of them is the easiest and most suitable for me way of living. If someone countered the same needs feel free to use this tiny util. And also feel free to folk and add your own versions.
